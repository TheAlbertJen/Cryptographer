Foci:
  - Abides In Stone:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 94
    Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
    Stat: Might
    Description: |
    You are a golem: a being of stone rather than flesh. Your stone body resembles that of a hulking humanoid, and you can move, speak, and feel pain. Your rock body means that it takes a lot to damage you, but once damaged, your wounds are not quite as easy to recover from. As someone made of animate stone, you typically do not wear clothing, although your stone skin is usually carved to appear as if you’re wearing it. Such carved clothing could be elaborate armor, robes, or stylistic ridges and ripples.

  - Awakens Dreams:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 95
    Genre: Fantasy
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Your dreams are more vivid than other people’s. When you dream, those dreams linger on, and when the time is right, you can loose them into reality to impress, confuse, or scare other creatures. You’ve learned the oneiromancer’s craft, which means that you know the secrets of lucid dreaming, gauging the dream state in others, and mixing herbal elixirs that bring about a restful, dream-filled sleep. Your clothing probably reflects the eclectic dreamland where you spend so much of your time, including several layers, bright silk ribbons, and odd symbols that made sense when you were dreaming them.

  - Battles Robots:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 97
    Genre: SciFi
    Stat: Speed
    Description: |
    Life is for the living—the biological. Automatons, robots, animate machines, thinking machines, and anything similar are abominations. You excel at battling these anathemas, cleansing the world of their contaminating presence. Maybe your desire to battle automatons comes from religious zealotry. Maybe it’s steeped in revenge for some past crime committed by a machine. Maybe you don’t know why you’re driven to destroy animate machines. Maybe you’re just good at it. You probably bear the trophies of former “kills” on you, wearing bits of circuitry or servos on your belt or around your neck. You also likely use heavy weaponry, ideal for penetrating armor. While sometimes a big, heavy weapon is useful against these foes, those who are quick and nimble, able to leap in and cut a few vital wires here or slice through a component panel there, also excel as robot hunters.

  - Bears a Halo of Fire:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 98
    Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You can create a sheath of flames around your body. You leave scorch marks wherever you go, and you can’t handle combustible objects without first dousing your inherent flames. If you have other extraordinary abilities, all your effects are tainted with flame. Fiery visuals accompany your powers, and in some cases, your predilection for flame actually reshapes your abilities to take on a fiery nature where none existed before. You probably wear red and yellow, or perhaps black.

  - Blazes with Radiance:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 99
    Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You have the ability to create and sculpt light, to bend it away from you or gather it to use as a weapon. You might gain your powers from the sun, or you might wield a mysterious artifact that produces light that you can manipulate. Regardless, you love the light and curse the darkness. People are often drawn to those wielding the light, either because they are heartened by it (as opposed to someone lurking in darkness) or because it is dramatic and impressive. Of course, those who enjoy the darkness or fear the light despise you. Most people able to command light favor bright colors in their clothing since those colors reflect light rather than absorb it.

  - Builds Robots:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 100
    Genre: Fantasy, SciFi
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Your brilliance is mechanically focused, and it allows you to create artificial entities who accept you for who you are. As an added bonus, they do what you command without complaint. You’re not entirely sure you’ve arrived at nirvana by surrounding yourself with artificial beings, but it’ll do for now. Because your robots don’t have an opinion, you’re not too concerned with your appearance. You tend to throw the same shop coat over whatever you happen to be wearing beneath.

  - Calculates the Incalculable:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 101
    Genre: Modern, SciFi
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Other people are a little in awe of your mind, though you feel normal enough. Admittedly, you are sometimes surprised when others fail to grasp easy concepts, or how they don’t share your appreciation of the beauty in dynamical systems theory, elliptic curve geometry, Riemann meromorphic functions, and all the other wondrous things. You live a little too much in your head to concern yourself with how you look. Your hair is probably slightly too long and tousled, your clothing is casual and stained with coffee, and your socks don’t match.

  - Carries a Quiver:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 102
    Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
    Stat: Speed
    Description: |
    The archer is a skilled combatant, deadly in any fight. With a keen eye and quick reflexes, you can eliminate foes at range before they reach you. A good archer also learns to make his own arrows and bows. You probably wear no more than light armor so you can move quickly when needed. You can use this focus with crossbows instead of bows if you wish.

  - Casts Spells:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 103
    Genre: Fantasy
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You can cast spells of arcing lightning, rolling fire, creeping shadow, and summoning. As a spellcaster, you understand that the world is a construct built on hidden formulas, flows of energy, and encrypted arcane secrets. Spells are specific flaws in reality that have been identified, studied, and codified into a spellbook for ease of reference and use. Though you likely apprenticed under a more accomplished spellcaster, sorcerer, or wizard, you quickly learned that the most powerful spells—those that can alter a creature’s form, open pathways to other worlds, or kill with a single word—are jealously guarded secrets even among friendly spellcasters, including between master and apprentice. You probably wear sturdy robes stitched with esoteric symbols, carry a staff etched with indecipherable glyphs, and, last but certainly not least, carry a tome of magic spells wherever you go.

  - Channels Divine Blessings:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 105
    Genre: Fantasy
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You are a devout follower of a divine being and serve as its representative among mortals. In other words, you are a priest. The power of your god or gods flows through you and allows you to perform miracles on their behalf. You wear simple clothes, though you also display the symbols and insignia of your deity. Normally humble, you are strident when speaking with the authority of the divine.

  - Commands Mental Powers:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 107
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, Supernatural, Superhero
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You have always had special abilities that others didn’t seem to share. Through practice and devotion, you have honed this unique talent so that you can harness the power of your mind to perform deeds. No one can tell that you have this ability just by looking at you, although you wear a crystal or jewel somewhere on your head to help focus your power. Either this focusing object was given to you by someone who recognized your ability, or you came upon it by accident and it triggered your abilities. Some people with mental powers—often called psychics or psionics by ordinary folks—are secretive and a little paranoid.

  - Conducts Weird Science:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 109
    Genre: Modern, SciFi
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You could be a respected scientist, having been published in several peer-reviewed journals. Or you might be considered a crank by your contemporaries, pursuing fringe theories on what others consider to be scant evidence. Truth is, you have a particular gift for sifting the edges of what’s possible. You can find new insights and unlock odd phenomena with your experiments. Where others see a crackpot cornucopia, you sift the conspiracy theories for revelation. Whether you conduct your enquiries as a government contractor, a university researcher, a corporate scientist, or an indulger of curiosity in your own garage lab following your muse, you push the boundaries of what’s possible. You probably care more about your work than trivialities such as your appearance, polite or proper behavior, or social norms, but then again, an eccentric like you might turn the tables on that stereotype too.

  - Consorts With the Dead:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 110
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, Supernatural
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Through the study of science or magic to which most people give a wide berth, you have mastered the ability to speak with and reanimate the dead. Necromancy, however, is shunned as a taboo. It is gruesome, morbid, and in the eyes of most, forbidden. You probably wear black clothing, which might be adorned with skulls, bones, teeth, or other symbols of death. Some who consort with the dead paint their skin and dye their hair black, red, and white to bring them visually closer to the bodies they interact with.

  - Controls Beasts:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 111
    Genre: Fantasy
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    To say that you have a way with animals and nonhuman creatures doesn’t begin to cover it. Your mastery and communication with beasts is positively uncanny. They come to you fearlessly, and it’s not uncommon for birds to alight on your shoulder or for small animals to climb up your arms or legs. You probably wear tough clothing and have a disheveled or grizzled appearance that suggests a rugged, outdoor life. Perhaps you even smell like an animal.

  - Controls Gravity:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 113
    Genre: Superhero
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Gravity is a force so basic and primal that we take it for granted. Through a quirk of fate, some unique device(s), or supreme devotion (or a combination of all three), you have learned to tap into the power of gravity. You might prefer billowy garments that display your mastery of gravity’s pull and conceal your identity and intentions.

  - Crafts Illusions:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 114
    Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You create holographic images that appear real. You are, in effect, an artist—a crafter of light and sound. Holographic images can never inflict direct harm or exert real force, but they can fool creatures, changing opinions and even behaviors if you craft them cleverly. You likely dress with flair and color. The appearance of things is important to you, both their beauty and their ugliness. You are a visual performer who can entertain, terrify, or fool everyone you encounter.

  - Crafts Unique Objects:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 116
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    The raw materials for a crafter offer themselves to those who know where to look. You are a maker, a crafter, an inventor, and a builder. You might start out working with wood or metal, but eventually you will master far greater creations. Whether magic or technology is your field, you know that you can master it and use it for your own designs. You likely carry a wide array of tools and spare parts wherever you go. Your work apron is probably a mainstay of your wardrobe, its pockets and loops brimming with the instruments of your trade. Your calloused fingers might be stained with grease that will never come completely clean, but these marks are badges of honor.

  - Defends the Weak:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 116
    Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Someone has to stand up for the helpless, the weak, and the unprotected. You believe this duty, this obligation, falls to you, and thus you have spent much of your life watching out for the people around you. When you see them in trouble, you are the first to come to their aid. You might give up your last dime to help the hungry, take a beating to save a person from the same, or rally your friends to take on injustice wherever you find it. You probably bear many scars from previous conflicts, but for each scar, you likely also have a token of gratitude. You may have a dried flower given to you by a lady you saved from brigands, or a bit of metal given to you by a starving man you fed.

  - Doesn’t Do Much:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 118
    Genre: Modern, SciFi
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You’re a slacker. You’ve had a number of jobs in your life, but nothing’s really stuck. No one thing consumes you, compels you, or drives you. You float from event to event. That doesn’t mean you’re unhappy, necessarily. It’s not a bad life. You like to take it easy. Appreciate the little things. Partake in a few relaxing substances now and again. Enjoy the rug that ties the whole room together. Not a lot of stress, and you know a little about a lot of different things. You dress casually. You might be in decent physical shape—if, you know, that’s your thing—or maybe you’re more cerebral (a pseudo-intellectual). It’s all good.

  - Employs Magnetism:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 119
    Genre: Superhero
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Electromagnetism is a fundamental force in the universe, and it is yours to command. You are a master of metal. You probably wear a lot of metal, perhaps as part of your clothing or armor, as part of your accessories (such as jewelry or piercings), embedded into your body surgically, or in some combination of these options.

  - Entertains:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 120
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, SciFi
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You are an entertainer: a singer, dancer, poet, storyteller, or something similar. You perform for the benefit of others. Naturally charismatic and talented, you have also studied to master your art. You know all the old poems, songs, jokes, and stories, and you’re skilled at creating new ones, too. You probably wear flamboyant or at least fashionable clothes and use cosmetics, tattoos, or hair stylings for dramatic effect.

  - Exists in Two Places at Once:
    Book: CSR
    Book: CSR
    Page: 120
    Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
    Stat: Might, Intellect
    Description: |
    One day, you looked into a mirror or another reflective surface and noticed that the reflection didn’t quite match your movements. After some time, the image stepped free from the surface and where there was one, there were now two. You have a doppelganger, a duplicate you can call into existence when you wish. This duplicate may be a quirk of your nature, brought on by exposure to weird energy or a piece of scarcely understood technology. Then again, this other might hail from another reality, a branching timeline that may be similar to or quite different from your own. Of course, the copy could simply be a manifestation of your will on a cloud of nanites that assume your shape when you command them. Whatever the reason for your ability, you can call forth the copy and be in two places at once. Your duplicate is your twin. It shares more than your appearance. It duplicates your mannerisms, manner of speech, expressions, and habits. In effect, you have another you.

  - Exists Partially Out of Phase:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 122
    Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You have the ability to change your phase state. In fact, you’re always slightly out of phase, giving you a ghostly translucence. With concentration, you can pass your hand through a solid object, allow a solid object to pass harmlessly through you, or literally walk through walls. However, moving in and out of different phase states requires extreme force of will and can be mentally taxing. You might do whatever you can to play up your translucent appearance by wearing diaphanous, billowy clothing, or, depending on your personality, you might do just the opposite.

  - Explores Dark Places:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 123
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern
    Stat: Speed
    Description: |
    You explore foreboding ruins, mysterious locales of ancient times, dungeons deep, dark caverns, and similar places, trained in such activities by those who have gone before you. You’re the archetypal treasure hunter, scavenger, and finder of lost things. You spend so much of your time in the dark that you slowly adapt to it, almost becoming a creature of the gloom yourself. Even in civilized areas, you prefer to keep to the shadows. Most likely, you wear dark clothing to help you blend into the blackness. On the other hand, you might wear sensible garments and gear because you have serious and dangerous business to attend to in the dark.

  - Explores Deep Waters:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 124
    Genre: Superhero
    Stat: Speed, Intellect
    Description: |
    You have nothing to fear from the depths. You have always been a good swimmer, able to hold your breath longer than anyone else, tread water for as long as you wanted, and delve deeper into the swirling darkness than your friends, all without stretching your resources. The depths you so freely explore harbor many secrets, and the waters that shelter you become part of who you are, an extension of your identity. When you bother to wear clothes, you favor snug, tight-fitting garments that stay close to your skin and do not hamper your mobility. The abilities granted by this focus might result from special equipment you make along the way, weird transformations that began when you first swam into the deepest, darkest places, or simply an expression of an unusual gift or heritage.

  - Fights Dirty:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 125
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, SciFi
    Stat: Speed, Intellect
    Description: |
    You know one thing for certain: the only important element of a fight is who wins. How? Why? These questions are inconsequential. Thus, you’ll do anything to win a fight. Some might say you have no honor, no class, or some other foolish statement, but they’re missing the point. You come out on top in a battle—and that’s all that matters. You bite, scratch, kick, and trip. You tangle foes in draperies, push them down stairs, and throw dirt in their eyes. You trick them into looking the wrong way, call them names, and say terrible things about their mothers. Maybe you learned your methods while living on the streets, or maybe you barely survived a particularly horrific battle in a military campaign. Perhaps you simply have never bought into the idea of rules or honor when your life is on the line. You’re likely to carry a few hidden tricks, sometimes literally up your sleeve. You might have a knife in your boot, a poisoned needle in your ring, a razor in the hem of your cloak, or a handful of stinging and itching powder in a hidden pocket. Your clothing probably has a lot of pockets, actually—more than a few of them well hidden.

  - Fights With Panache:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 126
    Genre: Fantasy, SciFi, Superhero
    Stat: Speed
    Description: |
    You know that style is at least as important as substance. Defeating foes is secondary to looking good while doing it. Some might call you a swashbuckler or daredevil. You leap through the air, make a flourish with your weapon, and attack, usually with a clever, biting show of wit. Your enemies hate you, but your allies adore you. Just watching you fight is entertaining. You very likely wear no armor, instead preferring stylish clothing—perhaps even a hat with a feather.

  - Focuses Mind Over Matter:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 128
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, Supernatural, SciFi, Superhero
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Telekinesis. Psychokinesis. Mind over matter. The power has many names, but in the end, it all boils down to one thing— the molecules that make up all matter are yours to command. You likely call yourself a telekinetic or just a TK. Many telekinetics prefer to wear tight clothing without many accoutrements so there is little another TK could grab hold of psychically. On the other hand, you have the power to create very minor telekinetic effects at will, so your hair might always be in motion, you could have a few tiny objects floating around you, or you might wear a long cape that’s always billowing.

  - Fuses Flesh and Steel:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 129
    Genre: SciFi, Superhero
    Stat: Might, Speed
    Description: |
    At some point in your past, some of your organic parts were replaced with artificial components. You are a cyborg. Bionic. Alternatively, you belong to a secret race of biomechanical hybrids. Your artificial components might be subdermal, or they might resemble overt metal or synth plating on your skin. They can also take the form of threadlike tendrils of circuitry winding across your flesh. Whatever their appearance, these components give you special abilities. As you advance, you can add to, modify, or discover new functions for them. Unfortunately, your artificial body also has special requirements when it takes damage. You probably wear a cloak with a hood or something similar to hide your artificial parts from those who would persecute you. Because your components are tricky to repair, as time goes on, it might become more difficult to conceal your true nature, with exposed circuitry, metal plates, and more in a state of partial disassembly.

  - Fuses Mind and Machine:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 131
    Genre: SciFi, Superhero
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You believe that the finest machine ever created is the human brain (although some scientists would disagree). Experience and training have taught you that any machine can be improved. Through the use of implants and mechanical enhancements, your brain processes input faster, stores more information, and eventually can tap right into the Internet (or similar data network). Mentally, you function on an entirely different level than your fellows. Did you make these improvements yourself? Did someone else? Was it with your blessing or against your will? Regardless, you are now more than just a person. You are both living creature and machine. But unlike what others might assume, all of your refinements and upgrades are on the inside. You don’t need mech eyes or metal arms to be enhanced. It’s all about what’s inside your skull.

  - Grows to Towering Heights:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 132
    Genre: Superhero
    Stat: Might
    Description: |
    You have the ability to become a towering giant for short periods. When you do, everything and everyone seems to shrink around you, until it’s like you’re walking through a children’s play area, where everything is sized for toddlers. As you grow ever larger, your sense of scale shifts further. At your maximum height, most other creatures are as insects, and unless you take care, you easily crush them beneath your colossal feet. When you’re not growing, you look normal. Only the clothing in direct contact with your skin grows with you, so you wear expensive outerwear only when you’re fairly certain you won’t have to trigger your Enlarge ability.

  - Howls at the Moon:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 134
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, Supernatural, Superhero
    Stat: Might, Speed
    Description: |
    You are a lycanthrope—a werewolf, werebear, wererat, weretiger, or something similar. You are cursed and blessed to be able to transform into a powerful creature, drawing additional mass from a transdimensional source. You and the GM should work out the exact nature of the creature, including its appearance, but it’s a wild beast of rage and blood—at least until you learn to control it. Style and appearance are probably low on your list of concerns. Your clothes might be ragged because your transformation is hard on them (or they’re cheap because you know they’ll be destroyed the next time you transform). 

  - Hunts Nonhumans:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 135
    Genre: Fantasy, SciFi
    Stat: Speed, Intellect
    Description: |
    You see orcs, lizard people, aliens from Rigel, elves, undead, or some other sort of inhuman group as a threat to humanity. The threat is obvious to you—they attack, abduct, enslave, prey upon, or murder humans. But the threat can also be far more subtle. They infiltrate, control, subvert, undermine, and terrorize. These threats must be eradicated for the good of all. Nonhuman hunters choose their dedicated foe and focus all their attention on that one opponent whenever possible. In this context, a nonhuman is something that isn’t human and often comes in great numbers. In a fantasy setting, it might be goblins. In a science fiction setting, it might be insectlike alien hordes. Zombies and in some cases mutants might also fit the bill, but keep in mind the similar focus Hunts Outcasts for those who specialize in fighting foes with supernatural abilities. Whatever the foe, hunters of nonhumans know their enemy’s tactics, methods, weapons, defenses, and abilities.

  - Hunts Outcasts:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 136
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, Supernatural
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Mutants. Witches. Aliens. They’ve got weird powers, and they’re a threat to everything you hold dear. They represent everything that is wrong with your world. They are a scourge upon humanity—a disease that must be put down. You don’t necessarily take pleasure in their eradication, but it must be done for the good of the human race. If this cancer is not destroyed now, it will only spread. You must choose a type of forbidden outcast or a hated supernatural person or being appropriate to the setting at hand. In this context, an outcast is something or someone that has powers or abilities beyond those of normal humans; examples include wizards or fey in a magical setting, mutants in a science fiction setting, weird psionic aliens, ghosts, vampires, and so on. You hunt them. You very likely have had experiences with the outcasts in your past. You know that they’re all not hideous monstrosities—that’s the problem. Outcasts who are not obvious typically pose the greatest threat because they can hide in plain sight. As an outcast hunter, you know that it takes special tools to fight creatures with crazy powers and abilities. You have learned to adapt devices to aid in finding outcasts and defending yourself against them. This might mean imbibing or injecting potions, nanites, or other strange treatments to even the odds.

  - Hunts With Great Skill:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 137
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern
    Stat: Speed, Intellect
    Description: |
    You are a tracker. Perhaps you hunt animals or more deadly creatures. Perhaps you go after people as a bounty hunter, law enforcer, or killer for hire. Whatever form your hunting takes, you are trained in stalking your quarry and bringing it down. You are a dangerous individual. If you hunt animals or creatures, you might carry the trophies of past kills, such as teeth or skins. If you’re a bounty hunter, you probably wear whatever your quarry would find most intimidating so it feels as though it has no chance of getting away from you.

  - Infiltrates:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 138
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, SciFi, Supernatural
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You focus on subtlety, guile, and stealth. Your body has been trained (or perhaps even genetically or magically altered) to make you the perfect infiltrator. You use a wide variety of disguises and tools to perform your duties, but your greatest tools are your own skills and training. Infiltrators are spies, agents, thieves, assassins, or information gatherers. They often wear slick bodysuits and face-concealing masks when not wearing a disguise.

  - Interprets the Law:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 139
    Genre: Modern, SciFi
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You know the law as well as the back of your hand. Broad mandates, narrow rulings, well-meaning overreaches, regulatory considerations, and outright loopholes in the law are all the tools you need to twist outcomes to suit your desire. Knowledge is power, which is why many people who have crossed you now fear you. It’s your decision whether you put your prowess toward noble causes or use it for your own aggrandizement. You wear nice suits and designer sunglasses, carry a briefcase, and walk around in shoes that cost more than many people earn in a month.

  - Is Idolized by Millions:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 140
    Genre: SciFi
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Some celebrities are known for their talent, while others are simply known for being known. However the spotlight found you, you’re a celebrity now, and people love you—often a little too much. You can’t go anywhere publicly without people recognizing you, approaching you for a shared selfie, or pointing at you from afar. Whenever you do anything, whether it’s going to the beach, adopting a new pet, or going out clubbing, the event becomes pablum for celebrity TV shows and websites, which often twist the facts into a caricature of reality. But hey, like your publicists say, no PR is bad PR. You wear oversized sunglasses, designer clothing, and expensive shoes that are also comfortable.

  - Is Licensed to Carry:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 142
    Genre: Modern
    Stat: Speed
    Description: |
    You’re a proficient adversary when armed. Hundreds of hours of training mean that you don’t crack when under fire; you take care of business before the bad guys even know you’re there. Those who are Licensed to Carry might be cops, crooks, hunters, or citizens interested in protecting themselves. You dress in clothing that allows you either to conceal your weapon or to quickly access it, and preferably both, which is why you’re probably known for your trench coat.

  - Leads:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 143
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, Superhero
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Using charisma, natural leadership, and perhaps some training, you command the actions of others, who follow you willingly. You are a politician, a captain, a leader, or a manager. Your skills allow you to make people do what you want, but you also have the wisdom to know what actions would be best for your followers and allies. Since you need the respect of others, you probably dress and carry yourself in such a way that inspires, endears, or intimidates. You have a voice suited to barking orders that can be heard even on a noisy battlefield.

  - Lives in the Wilderness:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 144
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You dwell in the wilds. You probably have done so most, if not all, of your life, coming to understand the mysteries of nature, weather, and survival. The ways of flora and fauna are your ways. Your rough, rugged clothing shows little concern for style. Most of the time, covering yourself in natural smells to keep your scent from arousing suspicion in the wilderness is more important than bathing to keep yourself presentable to other humans.

  - Looks for Trouble:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 145
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, SciFi, Superhero
    Stat: Might
    Description: |
    You are a fighter. A scrapper. You like nothing more than to take off the kid gloves and confront your opposition in the most direct way possible. You don’t hide, and you don’t shirk. You take things head-on in a physical way. Your friends all likely feel better about going into danger with you at their side or their back. You probably wear bright colors—yellow, pink, or red—to help you stand out. You might even wear a T-shirt with a printed obscenity for added style.

  - Masters Defense:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 146
    Genre: Fantasy, SciFi, Superhero
    Stat: Speed
    Description: |
    Protecting yourself is obviously important in dangerous situations, and you are particularly good at it. Cautious and prudent, you learn techniques to defend against all kinds of attacks, both physical and mental. The winner is often the last person standing, and you’ve done all you can to ensure that person will be you. You carry a shield and probably wear the best armor you can find.

  - Masters the Swarm:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 147
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, Supernatural
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Insects. Rats. Bats. Even birds. You master one type of small creature, and they respond to you in number. It’s a weird skill—as you’ve been told far too many times—but you’ve seen the benefits both in and out of battle, and you’ve fully embraced it. Your dress likely bears some mark of your predilections. Random creatures of your chosen kind sometimes alight on your person even when you don’t purposefully call them.

  - Masters Weaponry:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 148
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, SciFi, Superhero
    Stat: Might, Speed
    Description: |
    You have worked long and hard with one particular type of weapon: swords, axes, daggers, whips, or whatever you choose. Thus, you are a swordsman, an axemaster, a mistress of knives, or whatever is appropriate to your chosen weapon. A master of the rapier is different from a master of the warhammer. You might wear a symbol—a badge, a pin, a tattoo, an amulet, certain colors, and so on—that indicates the school in which you trained, the style of fighting you have mastered, or the name of your mentor. Your weapon is almost certainly your finest possession. Not only is it well cared for and of high quality, but you probably keep it in a beautiful scabbard, harness, belt, case, or something similar.

  - Metes Out Justice:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 149
    Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
    Stat: Might, Speed
    Description: |
    So much injustice in the world. It takes a special person to take it upon himself to right wrongs, protect the innocent, and punish the guilty. You are such a person. Justicars, as they are sometimes called, are often knights errant who wear armor, bear swords and shields, and travel the land looking for tyranny, corruption, or oppression. But some operate a little less ostentatiously. Sometimes justice comes from more subtle tactics. In a more modern setting, a justicar might be a masked vigilante or just a badass who rights wrongs. The importance of justice in your life might come from religion, your upbringing, or your highly developed sense of principles. Regardless, you not only adhere to your values, but you also believe it is your calling to act on them and help make the world more just, more fair, and more ethical. You want to see wrongdoing punished.

  - Moves Like a Cat:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 150
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, SciFi, Superhero
    Stat: Speed
    Description: |
    You are extremely dexterous. Your speed and agility make you almost a thing of wonder. Your body is lithe, flexible, and graceful. Your training—or perhaps a bit of magic or technology—allows you to move quickly and smoothly, land safely when you fall, and avoid danger. You likely wear tight clothing that doesn’t hinder you as you move. Likewise, you probably don’t allow yourself to be overburdened by a lot of equipment. You’ll wear armor only if it doesn’t slow you down.

  - Moves Like the Wind:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 151
    Genre: Superhero
    Stat: Speed
    Description: |
    You are extraordinarily fast. Through some agency beyond human limits (such as magic, technology, mutant powers, or the like), you are a blur of movement. You can outrun anyone, and as your abilities increase, you can eventually run rings around flying birds or speeding cars. You likely wear tight clothing that doesn’t hinder you as you move. Likewise, you probably don’t allow yourself to be overburdened by a lot of equipment.

  - Murders:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 152
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, SciFi, 
    Stat: Speed
    Description: |
    The murderous assassin is a master of dealing death. No one is better at sneaking into a location, eliminating a target, and slipping out again. Obviously, a professional killer is not likely to have a lot of friends. You probably wear dark colors—black, charcoal grey, or midnight blue—to help blend into the shadows. But since you’re also a master of disguise, in truth you could look like anyone.

  - Needs No Weapon:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 153
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, SciFi, Superhero
    Stat: Might, Speed
    Description: |
    You don’t use weapons—you are a weapon. With powerful punches, kicks, and full- body moves, you inflict incredible damage on your foes. By focusing your energy, the combined power of your body and mind means you can do incredible amounts of damage without depleting your energy reserves. You might have gained your skills through intense training, various implants and enhancements, genetic mutations, or any combination of these things. Whatever the origin of your feats, you likely take good care of your body, ensuring that it remains the sharpest, most dependable weapon at your disposal. Weaponless martial artists are both feared and revered. They wear loose, comfortable clothing that allows them a full range of movement, and they rarely use weapons other than their body’s own implements (although some carry items designed to enhance their body movements for greater effect, such as knuckle weapons, knee spikes, or boot blades).

  - Never Says Die:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 154
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, SciFi, Superhero
    Stat: Might
    Description: |
    You are as stalwart, hardy, and driven as can be imagined. When others are ready to quit, you’re just getting started. You probably don’t spend a lot of time on your appearance—it is far less important than actions. For that matter, so are words. You’re likely not much of a talker. You’re a doer. Characters with this focus are sometimes called stalwarts or diehards. They often are soldiers, mercenaries, or other tough-as-nails individuals, but sometimes they take a more heroic stance. A character who is hard to kill is around longer to help others, after all.

  - Operates Undercover:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 155
    Genre: Modern, SciFi, Superhero
    Stat: Might, Intellect
    Description: |
    Espionage is not something you know anything about. At least, that’s what you want everyone to believe, because in truth, you’ve been trained as a spy or covert agent. You might work for a government or for yourself. You might be a police detective or a criminal. You could even be an investigative reporter. Regardless, you learn information that others attempt to keep secret. You collect rumors and whispers, stories and hard-won evidence, and you use that knowledge to aid your own endeavors and, if appropriate, provide your employers with the information they desire. Alternatively, you might sell what you have learned to those willing to pay a premium. You probably wear dark colors—black, charcoal grey, or midnight blue—to help blend into the shadows, unless the cover you’ve chosen requires you to look like someone else.

  - Performs Feats of Strength:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 156
    Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
    Stat: Might
    Description: |
    A lifetime of physical training rewards you with incredible power. Your muscles ripple beneath your skin, evident in your extraordinary build and frame, and you can do things others would not dream possible. You can haul incredible weight, hurl your body through the air, and punch through doors. Superior strength can manifest in many ways. You could have the physique of a bodybuilder, almost godlike in its perfection, or you might be a lumbering, hulking monster of a person, as heavy with fat as you are with muscle. Then again, you could be short and wiry, your strength belied by your slight frame.

  - Pilots Starcraft:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 156
    Genre: SciFi
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You’re a crack starship pilot. You feel most alive when the engines are running hot, the floor plates are thrumming beneath your feet, and the stars stream past the viewports in a continuous accelerating streak. Whether you pilot starcraft along a dangerous trade route, explore places no one has gone before, or work as a courier, you are the master of your own domain: your starship. Piloting is a glamorous job that requires glamorous attire, so you wear striking clothing, possibly including holo- tattoos, data jewelry, and other elaborate accessories.

  - Rages:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 158
    Genre: Superhero
    Stat: Might, Intellect
    Description: |
    The berserker is a feared fighter who cannot be stopped. You put yourself into a howling battle frenzy that can make you a terror on the battlefield. You might hail from a less civilized society, perhaps even a tribal one. You likely wear little or no armor so as not to restrict your speed or maneuverability. Your clothing is probably simple and utilitarian.

  - Rides the Lightning:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 159
    Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Through practice and inherent ability (or the subtle use of hidden or implanted devices), you control electricity. Not only can you create and discharge electrical power, but you can eventually learn to use it to transport yourself. You probably wear tight-fitting clothing that allows you to move quickly. Your garments might be blue and black, perhaps with a lightning-bolt motif.

  - Sees Beyond:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 160
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, Supernatural
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Unlike most people, you know there are far more than three dimensions. More colors than can be found in the rainbow. More things in the world than most can see, sense, or even understand. With practice and help (through drugs, lenses, manipulated energy fields, magic, special heritage, or a combination of some or all of these), you can perceive things that others cannot. What you see in other dimensions has changed your understanding of even the most basic things like weapon and dress. Where others might see your drab outfit and plain weapons, you see something entirely different—myriad colors and patterns that showcase your unique vision of the world. Your weapons likely bear marks of other dimensions as well.

  - Separates Mind From Body:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 162
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, Supernatural
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Your mind is to your body as a captain is to her ship. Your body obeys your commands, moving and behaving as you direct it, but at any time you choose, your mind can wriggle free from its container and explore the world freely. When you project your mind, there are few places you cannot go, few secrets that can remain hidden from you. You probably regard your body as merely a vessel. As a result, you’re not likely to put a lot of effort into style or keeping yourself especially clean. Your clothing is likely tattered and dirty.

  - Shepherds Spirits:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 163
    Genre: Fantasy
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You see things that others do not: wandering souls of the dead, nature spirits, ephemeral figures leaping amid the flames of a fire, and all the other unseen folk. You can speak to these otherworldly entities and interact with them. They are drawn to you, for they recognize that you walk in two worlds. Shepherds usually wear distinctive robes and a variety of symbols, often with macabre imagery. Runes stitched across your cloak help you concentrate on your abilities.

  - Siphons Power:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 165
    Genre: Fantasy, SciFi, Superhero
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You are an energy vampire, draining power from machines or living creatures. You use this power to restore your own physical energy reserves. Perhaps you take great joy in this ability, or perhaps you grudgingly accept it as a boon to yourself and your companions and use it only when you must. Either way, you are likely feared and unwelcome in many communities for your dangerous powers. You might try to conceal your true nature, dressing so that you don’t attract attention and give yourself away, or perhaps you flaunt it, using the rumors to your advantage, wearing black clothing and embodying a sinister countenance.

  - Slays Monsters:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 166
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, Supernatural
    Stat: Might
    Description: |
    You live in a world populated not just by normal folk, but by creatures that should belong only to tall tales or nightmares. Dragons. Gorgons. Many-headed hydras. Werewolves. Worse. You decided to stand up to this menace, even though it means putting yourself in more peril. And if you give your life, others will tell stories of your bravery. Usually heavily armed and armored knights, monster slayers are often afforded great respect.

  - Solves Mysteries:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 167
    Genre: Modern, SciFi, Superhero
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You are a master of deduction. With a keen eye for detail and a quick wit, you can use a selection of clues to figure out what really happened when others are left scratching their heads. While a character that solves mysteries might be thought of as a detective or an investigator, a professor or even a scientist might also be a mystery solver. You wear sensible clothing and comfortable shoes, walking that fine line between practical and stylish. You might carry a briefcase for all the tools you require to solve mysteries.

  - Speaks for the Land:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 169
    Genre: Fantasy
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You not only speak for the land, you alsoprotect it and the natural creatures andforests that it supports. In that sense, youare the land’s champion. You might be partof an ancient priesthood of a select fewwho are able to commune with the spiritsof nature and who call upon the magicof the forest, moon, storm, and beast. Inparticular, you know how certain long-livedtrees are conduits of worldly magic. Whenlightning falls from the sky, fires rage, or theearth shakes, these elder trees channel thatelemental fury into themselves. An eventmay burn away a limb or blow off bark,but the energy contained within the treebecomes part of the magic of the land—magic that you, in turn, draw upon.As a speaker for the land, you probablywear rough, rugged clothing that showslittle concern for style. Most of the time,covering yourself in natural smells to keepyour scent from spooking wildlife is moreimportant than bathing to be presentable toother humans.

  - Stands Like a Bastion:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 170
    Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
    Stat: Might
    Description: |
    You are a wall. A stone. An island against a storm of weapons and words. Nothing moves you. Nothing even really dents you. Perhaps it’s your physical size that lends you such stopping power, perhaps you’ve enhanced your physique with mechanisms and machinery, or perhaps it’s merely your incredible strength of will that forces foes to stay their swings. Your armor is probably just like you: solid, strong, and utterly impenetrable. Every flourish and bit of flair—if you have any— does double duty as protection.

  - Talks to Machines:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 171
    Genre: SciFi, Superhero
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Since you were young, you had an affinity for machines. It seemed almost like you were speaking to them. You were. You have the ability to use your organic brain like a computer, interfacing “wirelessly” with any electronic device. You can control and influence them in ways that others can’t. Computers are your friends and companions. You have also learned to repair machines of all kinds because the better they work, the better off you are as well. You likely wear a tool belt full of various implements, and machine oils stain your clothes and fingertips.

  - Throws With Deadly Accuracy:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 173
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, Superhero
    Stat: Speed
    Description: |
    Sometimes you wonder if your hand and your mind’s eye are connected in an intricate perfection of timing and aim. Everything that leaves your hand goes exactly where you’d like it to and at the range and speed to make the perfect impact. Your expertise might be in carefully crafted throwing daggers and shuriken, or perhaps you use whatever’s nearby. What you wear doesn’t matter, as long as it doesn’t come between you and your throwing implements. Lots of pockets, equipment belts, and pouches make it easy to keep your preferred weapons close at hand. You might even have a hat with a variety of throwing items tucked into its brim, ready to meet their target with your perfect aim.

  - Travels Through Time:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 174
    Genre: Fantasy, SciFi, Superhero
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You have the unusual ability to travel through time in a way others can never dream of. You have likely experienced jumps where time seems to have passed but you have no memory of what happened. You probably also suffer from déjà vu, sensing that you have been in a situation or witnessed an event before and are now experiencing it all over again. You have begun to realize the extent of your powers and work to master them so that perhaps one day you can travel farther into the future or deeper into the past. Time travel poses many risks. Often, you have no clear sense about what the future might hold or what might have been happening in the spot where you appear when you travel to the past. Death waits for the bold and the incautious. Worse than mishap, you must guard against paradox. When you change an event in the past, you could inadvertently cause the future to be rewritten. On the other hand, cosmic forces may move in to correct paradoxes by changing circumstances to accommodate the ability, causing your memories to become false ones when the world you know changes to adapt to your meddling. Of course, if you attempt anything too radical, the universe might write you out of existence so that your efforts to change the past never occur. You likely wear clothing and have personal effects in a range of styles, choosing items from many different periods. This eclectic approach to your possessions may give you a shabby appearance or make you look strange and alien to others in the present. Any type of character can have this focus, though its power is extraordinarily rare.

  - Wears a Sheen of Ice:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 176
    Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Through your studies, you have learned to focus your natural talents to command the powers of ice and cold. People might refer to you as an ice mage. Sometimes ice mages are thought to come into conflict with those known as fire mages, but this is a fallacy believed by ordinary folks more than anything based in truth. You likely wear white or blue garments that are heavier than they need to be— unless you live in a cold region or wintry clime, in which case you probably wear less clothing than other people do because the cold doesn’t bother you.

  - Wields Two Weapons at Once:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 177
    Genre: Fantasy
    Stat: Might, Speed
    Description: |
    You bear steel with both hands, ready to take on any foe. You fight with two weapons in melee, sometimes called dual wielding. A fearsome warrior, quick and strong, you believe that the best defense is a strong offense. You probably sheathe one weapon on each side or both crossed behind your back. They are likely your most prized possessions, and you might have names for them.

  - Works Miracles:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 178
    Genre: Fantasy
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You manipulate matter and time to help others and are beloved by everyone you encounter. Some people consider you a representative of the gods or a power from beyond this world. Perhaps they’re right. Your abilities might be a gift of the angels or a powerful and benevolent god. You probably wear simple clothes— nothing too flashy or stylish. There’s no need to call more attention to yourself.

  - Works the Back Alleys:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 179
    Genre: Fantasy, Modern, SciFi
    Stat: Speed, Intellect
    Description: |
    The thief, the burglar, the pickpocket: these are the dangerous individuals who haunt the back alleys of every community. You are a thief in a city or town, making your livelihood at the expense of the wealthy. Your talents, however, prepare you for all kinds of pursuits, even when you’re not crouching in an alley or climbing into a window. Usually, you dress to blend in with the crowd. When you’re on a mission, black, form-fitting clothing allows you to swim in the shadows.

  - Works the System:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 180
    Genre: Modern, SciFi
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    You’ve knocked around a lot and run afoul of the law a few times, but you’ve evaded authorities on a variety of fronts more often than not. That’s because you are adept at noticing flaws and exploits in systems, whether those systems are civil laws, investment regulations, computer codes, games of all sorts, or similar artificial constructions. Once you notice and fully comprehend a system, you can manipulate it to your own ends. You are a manipulator, but you likely keep a term like that to yourself. Tell people you’re an entrepreneur—that always sounds good.

  - Would Rather Be Reading:
    Book: CSR
    Page: 181
    Genre: Modern, SciFi
    Stat: Intellect
    Description: |
    Your whole life, people have been asking you why you read so much. Would you rather read about life than live it, they ask? Yes, you answer, probably inwardly. Books are your friends. You love fiction that gives you escape and nonfiction that enriches your mind. You’re always learning new things. What’s more important than knowledge? Nothing. You probably carry a bag of books (or a tablet with ebooks on it, or both) with you at all times.
