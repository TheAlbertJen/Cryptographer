- Abides In Stone:
  Page: 94
  Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
  Stat: Might
  Description: |
  You are a golem: a being of stone rather than flesh. Your stone body resembles that of a hulking humanoid, and you can move, speak, and feel pain. Your rock body means that it takes a lot to damage you, but once damaged, your wounds are not quite as easy to recover from. As someone made of animate stone, you typically do not wear clothing, although your stone skin is usually carved to appear as if you’re wearing it. Such carved clothing could be elaborate armor, robes, or stylistic ridges and ripples.

- Awakens Dreams:
  Page: 95
  Genre: Fantasy
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  Your dreams are more vivid than other people’s. When you dream, those dreams linger on, and when the time is right, you can loose them into reality to impress, confuse, or scare other creatures. You’ve learned the oneiromancer’s craft, which means that you know the secrets of lucid dreaming, gauging the dream state in others, and mixing herbal elixirs that bring about a restful, dream-filled sleep. Your clothing probably reflects the eclectic dreamland where you spend so much of your time, including several layers, bright silk ribbons, and odd symbols that made sense when you were dreaming them.

- Battles Robots:
  Page: 97
  Genre: SciFi
  Stat: Speed
  Description: |
  Life is for the living—the biological. Automatons, robots, animate machines, thinking machines, and anything similar are abominations. You excel at battling these anathemas, cleansing the world of their contaminating presence. Maybe your desire to battle automatons comes from religious zealotry. Maybe it’s steeped in revenge for some past crime committed by a machine. Maybe you don’t know why you’re driven to destroy animate machines. Maybe you’re just good at it. You probably bear the trophies of former “kills” on you, wearing bits of circuitry or servos on your belt or around your neck. You also likely use heavy weaponry, ideal for penetrating armor. While sometimes a big, heavy weapon is useful against these foes, those who are quick and nimble, able to leap in and cut a few vital wires here or slice through a component panel there, also excel as robot hunters.

- Bears a Halo of Fire:
  Page: 98
  Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  You can create a sheath of flames around your body. You leave scorch marks wherever you go, and you can’t handle combustible objects without first dousing your inherent flames. If you have other extraordinary abilities, all your effects are tainted with flame. Fiery visuals accompany your powers, and in some cases, your predilection for flame actually reshapes your abilities to take on a fiery nature where none existed before. You probably wear red and yellow, or perhaps black.

- Blazes with Radiance:
  Page: 99
  Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  You have the ability to create and sculpt light, to bend it away from you or gather it to use as a weapon. You might gain your powers from the sun, or you might wield a mysterious artifact that produces light that you can manipulate. Regardless, you love the light and curse the darkness. People are often drawn to those wielding the light, either because they are heartened by it (as opposed to someone lurking in darkness) or because it is dramatic and impressive. Of course, those who enjoy the darkness or fear the light despise you. Most people able to command light favor bright colors in their clothing since those colors reflect light rather than absorb it.

- Builds Robots:
  Page: 100
  Genre: Fantasy, SciFi
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  Your brilliance is mechanically focused, and it allows you to create artificial entities who accept you for who you are. As an added bonus, they do what you command without complaint. You’re not entirely sure you’ve arrived at nirvana by surrounding yourself with artificial beings, but it’ll do for now. Because your robots don’t have an opinion, you’re not too concerned with your appearance. You tend to throw the same shop coat over whatever you happen to be wearing beneath.

- Calculates the Incalculable:
  Page: 101
  Genre: Modern, SciFi
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  Other people are a little in awe of your mind, though you feel normal enough. Admittedly, you are sometimes surprised when others fail to grasp easy concepts, or how they don’t share your appreciation of the beauty in dynamical systems theory, elliptic curve geometry, Riemann meromorphic functions, and all the other wondrous things. You live a little too much in your head to concern yourself with how you look. Your hair is probably slightly too long and tousled, your clothing is casual and stained with coffee, and your socks don’t match.

- Carries a Quiver:
  Page: 102
  Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
  Stat: Speed
  Description: |
  The archer is a skilled combatant, deadly in any fight. With a keen eye and quick reflexes, you can eliminate foes at range before they reach you. A good archer also learns to make his own arrows and bows. You probably wear no more than light armor so you can move quickly when needed. You can use this focus with crossbows instead of bows if you wish.

- Casts Spells:
  Page: 103
  Genre: Fantasy
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  You can cast spells of arcing lightning, rolling fire, creeping shadow, and summoning. As a spellcaster, you understand that the world is a construct built on hidden formulas, flows of energy, and encrypted arcane secrets. Spells are specific flaws in reality that have been identified, studied, and codified into a spellbook for ease of reference and use. Though you likely apprenticed under a more accomplished spellcaster, sorcerer, or wizard, you quickly learned that the most powerful spells—those that can alter a creature’s form, open pathways to other worlds, or kill with a single word—are jealously guarded secrets even among friendly spellcasters, including between master and apprentice. You probably wear sturdy robes stitched with esoteric symbols, carry a staff etched with indecipherable glyphs, and, last but certainly not least, carry a tome of magic spells wherever you go.

- Channels Divine Blessings:
  Page: 105
  Genre: Fantasy
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  You are a devout follower of a divine being and serve as its representative among mortals. In other words, you are a priest. The power of your god or gods flows through you and allows you to perform miracles on their behalf. You wear simple clothes, though you also display the symbols and insignia of your deity. Normally humble, you are strident when speaking with the authority of the divine.

- Commands Mental Powers:
  Page: 107
  Genre: Fantasy, Modern, Supernatural, Superhero
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  You have always had special abilities that others didn’t seem to share. Through practice and devotion, you have honed this unique talent so that you can harness the power of your mind to perform deeds. No one can tell that you have this ability just by looking at you, although you wear a crystal or jewel somewhere on your head to help focus your power. Either this focusing object was given to you by someone who recognized your ability, or you came upon it by accident and it triggered your abilities. Some people with mental powers—often called psychics or psionics by ordinary folks—are secretive and a little paranoid.

- Conducts Weird Science:
  Page: 109
  Genre: Modern, SciFi
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  You could be a respected scientist, having been published in several peer-reviewed journals. Or you might be considered a crank by your contemporaries, pursuing fringe theories on what others consider to be scant evidence. Truth is, you have a particular gift for sifting the edges of what’s possible. You can find new insights and unlock odd phenomena with your experiments. Where others see a crackpot cornucopia, you sift the conspiracy theories for revelation. Whether you conduct your enquiries as a government contractor, a university researcher, a corporate scientist, or an indulger of curiosity in your own garage lab following your muse, you push the boundaries of what’s possible. You probably care more about your work than trivialities such as your appearance, polite or proper behavior, or social norms, but then again, an eccentric like you might turn the tables on that stereotype too.

- Consorts With the Dead:
  Page: 110
  Genre: Fantasy, Modern, Supernatural
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  Through the study of science or magic to which most people give a wide berth, you have mastered the ability to speak with and reanimate the dead. Necromancy, however, is shunned as a taboo. It is gruesome, morbid, and in the eyes of most, forbidden. You probably wear black clothing, which might be adorned with skulls, bones, teeth, or other symbols of death. Some who consort with the dead paint their skin and dye their hair black, red, and white to bring them visually closer to the bodies they interact with.

- Controls Beasts:
  Page: 111
  Genre: Fantasy
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  To say that you have a way with animals and nonhuman creatures doesn’t begin to cover it. Your mastery and communication with beasts is positively uncanny. They come to you fearlessly, and it’s not uncommon for birds to alight on your shoulder or for small animals to climb up your arms or legs. You probably wear tough clothing and have a disheveled or grizzled appearance that suggests a rugged, outdoor life. Perhaps you even smell like an animal.

- Controls Gravity:
  Page: 113
  Genre: Superhero
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  Gravity is a force so basic and primal that we take it for granted. Through a quirk of fate, some unique device(s), or supreme devotion (or a combination of all three), you have learned to tap into the power of gravity. You might prefer billowy garments that display your mastery of gravity’s pull and conceal your identity and intentions.

- Crafts Illusions:
  Page: 114
  Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  You create holographic images that appear real. You are, in effect, an artist—a crafter of light and sound. Holographic images can never inflict direct harm or exert real force, but they can fool creatures, changing opinions and even behaviors if you craft them cleverly. You likely dress with flair and color. The appearance of things is important to you, both their beauty and their ugliness. You are a visual performer who can entertain, terrify, or fool everyone you encounter.

- Crafts Unique Objects:
  Page: 116
  Genre: Fantasy, Modern
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  The raw materials for a crafter offer themselves to those who know where to look. You are a maker, a crafter, an inventor, and a builder. You might start out working with wood or metal, but eventually you will master far greater creations. Whether magic or technology is your field, you know that you can master it and use it for your own designs. You likely carry a wide array of tools and spare parts wherever you go. Your work apron is probably a mainstay of your wardrobe, its pockets and loops brimming with the instruments of your trade. Your calloused fingers might be stained with grease that will never come completely clean, but these marks are badges of honor.

- Defends the Weak:
  Page: 116
  Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  Someone has to stand up for the helpless, the weak, and the unprotected. You believe this duty, this obligation, falls to you, and thus you have spent much of your life watching out for the people around you. When you see them in trouble, you are the first to come to their aid. You might give up your last dime to help the hungry, take a beating to save a person from the same, or rally your friends to take on injustice wherever you find it. You probably bear many scars from previous conflicts, but for each scar, you likely also have a token of gratitude. You may have a dried flower given to you by a lady you saved from brigands, or a bit of metal given to you by a starving man you fed.

- Doesn’t Do Much:
  Page: 118
  Genre: Modern, SciFi
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  You’re a slacker. You’ve had a number of jobs in your life, but nothing’s really stuck. No one thing consumes you, compels you, or drives you. You float from event to event. That doesn’t mean you’re unhappy, necessarily. It’s not a bad life. You like to take it easy. Appreciate the little things. Partake in a few relaxing substances now and again. Enjoy the rug that ties the whole room together. Not a lot of stress, and you know a little about a lot of different things. You dress casually. You might be in decent physical shape—if, you know, that’s your thing—or maybe you’re more cerebral (a pseudo-intellectual). It’s all good.

- Employs Magnetism:
  Page: 119
  Genre: Superhero
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  Electromagnetism is a fundamental force in the universe, and it is yours to command. You are a master of metal. You probably wear a lot of metal, perhaps as part of your clothing or armor, as part of your accessories (such as jewelry or piercings), embedded into your body surgically, or in some combination of these options.

- Entertains:
  Page: 120
  Genre: Fantasy, Modern, SciFi
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  You are an entertainer: a singer, dancer, poet, storyteller, or something similar. You perform for the benefit of others. Naturally charismatic and talented, you have also studied to master your art. You know all the old poems, songs, jokes, and stories, and you’re skilled at creating new ones, too. You probably wear flamboyant or at least fashionable clothes and use cosmetics, tattoos, or hair stylings for dramatic effect.

- Exists in Two Places at Once:
  Page: 120
  Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
  Stat: Might, Intellect
  Description: |
  One day, you looked into a mirror or another reflective surface and noticed that the reflection didn’t quite match your movements. After some time, the image stepped free from the surface and where there was one, there were now two. You have a doppelganger, a duplicate you can call into existence when you wish. This duplicate may be a quirk of your nature, brought on by exposure to weird energy or a piece of scarcely understood technology. Then again, this other might hail from another reality, a branching timeline that may be similar to or quite different from your own. Of course, the copy could simply be a manifestation of your will on a cloud of nanites that assume your shape when you command them. Whatever the reason for your ability, you can call forth the copy and be in two places at once. Your duplicate is your twin. It shares more than your appearance. It duplicates your mannerisms, manner of speech, expressions, and habits. In effect, you have another you.

- Exists Partially Out of Phase:
  Page: 122
  Genre: Fantasy, Superhero
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  You have the ability to change your phase state. In fact, you’re always slightly out of phase, giving you a ghostly translucence. With concentration, you can pass your hand through a solid object, allow a solid object to pass harmlessly through you, or literally walk through walls. However, moving in and out of different phase states requires extreme force of will and can be mentally taxing. You might do whatever you can to play up your translucent appearance by wearing diaphanous, billowy clothing, or, depending on your personality, you might do just the opposite.

- Explores Dark Places:
  Page: 123
  Genre: Fantasy, Modern
  Stat: Speed
  Description: |
  You explore foreboding ruins, mysterious locales of ancient times, dungeons deep, dark caverns, and similar places, trained in such activities by those who have gone before you. You’re the archetypal treasure hunter, scavenger, and finder of lost things. You spend so much of your time in the dark that you slowly adapt to it, almost becoming a creature of the gloom yourself. Even in civilized areas, you prefer to keep to the shadows. Most likely, you wear dark clothing to help you blend into the blackness. On the other hand, you might wear sensible garments and gear because you have serious and dangerous business to attend to in the dark.

- Explores Deep Waters:
  Page: 124
  Genre: Superhero
  Stat: Speed, Intellect
  Description: |
  You have nothing to fear from the depths. You have always been a good swimmer, able to hold your breath longer than anyone else, tread water for as long as you wanted, and delve deeper into the swirling darkness than your friends, all without stretching your resources. The depths you so freely explore harbor many secrets, and the waters that shelter you become part of who you are, an extension of your identity. When you bother to wear clothes, you favor snug, tight-fitting garments that stay close to your skin and do not hamper your mobility. The abilities granted by this focus might result from special equipment you make along the way, weird transformations that began when you first swam into the deepest, darkest places, or simply an expression of an unusual gift or heritage.

- Fights Dirty:
  Page: 125
  Genre: Fantasy, Modern, SciFi
  Stat: Speed, Intellect
  Description: |
  You know one thing for certain: the only important element of a fight is who wins. How? Why? These questions are inconsequential. Thus, you’ll do anything to win a fight. Some might say you have no honor, no class, or some other foolish statement, but they’re missing the point. You come out on top in a battle—and that’s all that matters. You bite, scratch, kick, and trip. You tangle foes in draperies, push them down stairs, and throw dirt in their eyes. You trick them into looking the wrong way, call them names, and say terrible things about their mothers. Maybe you learned your methods while living on the streets, or maybe you barely survived a particularly horrific battle in a military campaign. Perhaps you simply have never bought into the idea of rules or honor when your life is on the line. You’re likely to carry a few hidden tricks, sometimes literally up your sleeve. You might have a knife in your boot, a poisoned needle in your ring, a razor in the hem of your cloak, or a handful of stinging and itching powder in a hidden pocket. Your clothing probably has a lot of pockets, actually—more than a few of them well hidden.

- Fights With Panache:
  Page: 126
  Genre: Fantasy, SciFi, Superhero
  Stat: Speed
  Description: |
  You know that style is at least as important as substance. Defeating foes is secondary to looking good while doing it. Some might call you a swashbuckler or daredevil. You leap through the air, make a flourish with your weapon, and attack, usually with a clever, biting show of wit. Your enemies hate you, but your allies adore you. Just watching you fight is entertaining. You very likely wear no armor, instead preferring stylish clothing—perhaps even a hat with a feather.

- Focuses Mind Over Matter:
  Page: 128
  Genre: Fantasy, Modern, Supernatural, SciFi, Superhero
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  Telekinesis. Psychokinesis. Mind over matter. The power has many names, but in the end, it all boils down to one thing— the molecules that make up all matter are yours to command. You likely call yourself a telekinetic or just a TK. Many telekinetics prefer to wear tight clothing without many accoutrements so there is little another TK could grab hold of psychically. On the other hand, you have the power to create very minor telekinetic effects at will, so your hair might always be in motion, you could have a few tiny objects floating around you, or you might wear a long cape that’s always billowing.

- Fuses Flesh and Steel:
  Page: 129
  Genre: SciFi, Superhero
  Stat: Might, Speed
  Description: |
  At some point in your past, some of your organic parts were replaced with artificial components. You are a cyborg. Bionic. Alternatively, you belong to a secret race of biomechanical hybrids. Your artificial components might be subdermal, or they might resemble overt metal or synth plating on your skin. They can also take the form of threadlike tendrils of circuitry winding across your flesh. Whatever their appearance, these components give you special abilities. As you advance, you can add to, modify, or discover new functions for them. Unfortunately, your artificial body also has special requirements when it takes damage. You probably wear a cloak with a hood or something similar to hide your artificial parts from those who would persecute you. Because your components are tricky to repair, as time goes on, it might become more difficult to conceal your true nature, with exposed circuitry, metal plates, and more in a state of partial disassembly.

- Fuses Mind and Machine:
  Page: 131
  Genre: SciFi, Superhero
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  You believe that the finest machine ever created is the human brain (although some scientists would disagree). Experience and training have taught you that any machine can be improved. Through the use of implants and mechanical enhancements, your brain processes input faster, stores more information, and eventually can tap right into the Internet (or similar data network). Mentally, you function on an entirely different level than your fellows. Did you make these improvements yourself? Did someone else? Was it with your blessing or against your will? Regardless, you are now more than just a person. You are both living creature and machine. But unlike what others might assume, all of your refinements and upgrades are on the inside. You don’t need mech eyes or metal arms to be enhanced. It’s all about what’s inside your skull.

- Grows to Towering Heights:
  Page: 132
  Genre: Superhero
  Stat: Might
  Description: |
  You have the ability to become a towering giant for short periods. When you do, everything and everyone seems to shrink around you, until it’s like you’re walking through a children’s play area, where everything is sized for toddlers. As you grow ever larger, your sense of scale shifts further. At your maximum height, most other creatures are as insects, and unless you take care, you easily crush them beneath your colossal feet. When you’re not growing, you look normal. Only the clothing in direct contact with your skin grows with you, so you wear expensive outerwear only when you’re fairly certain you won’t have to trigger your Enlarge ability.

- Howls at the Moon:
  Page: 134
  Genre: Fantasy, Modern, Supernatural, Superhero
  Stat: Might, Speed
  Description: |
  You are a lycanthrope—a werewolf, werebear, wererat, weretiger, or something similar. You are cursed and blessed to be able to transform into a powerful creature, drawing additional mass from a transdimensional source. You and the GM should work out the exact nature of the creature, including its appearance, but it’s a wild beast of rage and blood—at least until you learn to control it. Style and appearance are probably low on your list of concerns. Your clothes might be ragged because your transformation is hard on them (or they’re cheap because you know they’ll be destroyed the next time you transform). 

- Hunts Nonhumans:
  Page: 135
  Genre: Fantasy, SciFi
  Stat: Speed, Intellect
  Description: |
  You see orcs, lizard people, aliens from Rigel, elves, undead, or some other sort of inhuman group as a threat to humanity. The threat is obvious to you—they attack, abduct, enslave, prey upon, or murder humans. But the threat can also be far more subtle. They infiltrate, control, subvert, undermine, and terrorize. These threats must be eradicated for the good of all. Nonhuman hunters choose their dedicated foe and focus all their attention on that one opponent whenever possible. In this context, a nonhuman is something that isn’t human and often comes in great numbers. In a fantasy setting, it might be goblins. In a science fiction setting, it might be insectlike alien hordes. Zombies and in some cases mutants might also fit the bill, but keep in mind the similar focus Hunts Outcasts for those who specialize in fighting foes with supernatural abilities. Whatever the foe, hunters of nonhumans know their enemy’s tactics, methods, weapons, defenses, and abilities.

- Hunts Outcasts:
  Page: 136
  Genre: Fantasy, Modern, Supernatural
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  Mutants. Witches. Aliens. They’ve got weird powers, and they’re a threat to everything you hold dear. They represent everything that is wrong with your world. They are a scourge upon humanity—a disease that must be put down. You don’t necessarily take pleasure in their eradication, but it must be done for the good of the human race. If this cancer is not destroyed now, it will only spread. You must choose a type of forbidden outcast or a hated supernatural person or being appropriate to the setting at hand. In this context, an outcast is something or someone that has powers or abilities beyond those of normal humans; examples include wizards or fey in a magical setting, mutants in a science fiction setting, weird psionic aliens, ghosts, vampires, and so on. You hunt them. You very likely have had experiences with the outcasts in your past. You know that they’re all not hideous monstrosities—that’s the problem. Outcasts who are not obvious typically pose the greatest threat because they can hide in plain sight. As an outcast hunter, you know that it takes special tools to fight creatures with crazy powers and abilities. You have learned to adapt devices to aid in finding outcasts and defending yourself against them. This might mean imbibing or injecting potions, nanites, or other strange treatments to even the odds.

- Hunts With Great Skill:
  Page: 137
  Genre: Fantasy, Modern
  Stat: Speed, Intellect
  Description: |
  You are a tracker. Perhaps you hunt animals or more deadly creatures. Perhaps you go after people as a bounty hunter, law enforcer, or killer for hire. Whatever form your hunting takes, you are trained in stalking your quarry and bringing it down. You are a dangerous individual. If you hunt animals or creatures, you might carry the trophies of past kills, such as teeth or skins. If you’re a bounty hunter, you probably wear whatever your quarry would find most intimidating so it feels as though it has no chance of getting away from you.

- Infiltrates:
  Page: 138
  Genre: Fantasy, Modern, SciFi, Supernatural
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  You focus on subtlety, guile, and stealth. Your body has been trained (or perhaps even genetically or magically altered) to make you the perfect infiltrator. You use a wide variety of disguises and tools to perform your duties, but your greatest tools are your own skills and training. Infiltrators are spies, agents, thieves, assassins, or information gatherers. They often wear slick bodysuits and face-concealing masks when not wearing a disguise.

- Interprets the Law:
  Page: 139
  Genre: Modern, SciFi
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  You know the law as well as the back of your hand. Broad mandates, narrow rulings, well-meaning overreaches, regulatory considerations, and outright loopholes in the law are all the tools you need to twist outcomes to suit your desire. Knowledge is power, which is why many people who have crossed you now fear you. It’s your decision whether you put your prowess toward noble causes or use it for your own aggrandizement. You wear nice suits and designer sunglasses, carry a briefcase, and walk around in shoes that cost more than many people earn in a month.

- Is Idolized by Millions:
  Page: 140
  Genre: SciFi
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  Some celebrities are known for their talent, while others are simply known for being known. However the spotlight found you, you’re a celebrity now, and people love you—often a little too much. You can’t go anywhere publicly without people recognizing you, approaching you for a shared selfie, or pointing at you from afar. Whenever you do anything, whether it’s going to the beach, adopting a new pet, or going out clubbing, the event becomes pablum for celebrity TV shows and websites, which often twist the facts into a caricature of reality. But hey, like your publicists say, no PR is bad PR. You wear oversized sunglasses, designer clothing, and expensive shoes that are also comfortable.

- Is Licensed to Carry:
  Page: 142
  Genre: Modern
  Stat: Speed
  Description: |
  You’re a proficient adversary when armed. Hundreds of hours of training mean that you don’t crack when under fire; you take care of business before the bad guys even know you’re there. Those who are Licensed to Carry might be cops, crooks, hunters, or citizens interested in protecting themselves. You dress in clothing that allows you either to conceal your weapon or to quickly access it, and preferably both, which is why you’re probably known for your trench coat.

- Leads:
  Page: 143
  Genre: Fantasy, Modern, Superhero
  Stat: Intellect
  Description: |
  Using charisma, natural leadership, and perhaps some training, you command the actions of others, who follow you willingly. You are a politician, a captain, a leader, or a manager. Your skills allow you to make people do what you want, but you also have the wisdom to know what actions would be best for your followers and allies. Since you need the respect of others, you probably dress and carry yourself in such a way that inspires, endears, or intimidates. You have a voice suited to barking orders that can be heard even on a noisy battlefield.
